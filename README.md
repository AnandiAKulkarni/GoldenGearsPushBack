Purpose of this repository:
This repository is where we will store all our code as a robotics team competing in VEX AI. We are using JAR Template, which helps us make a basic drive code, including odometry to track the robot's location. 
We control timing and general robot actions in main.cpp, setup the robot in robot-config.cpp, and have all our autonomous functions in autons.cpp. Because we have 2 robots, we will have 2 branches in the repository.
